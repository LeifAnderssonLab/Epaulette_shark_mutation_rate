# Epaulette shark mutation rate estimation

This repository contains scripts necessary to re-conduct the de novo mutation rate estimation pipeline presented in our manuscript: 
Sendell-Price et al. (2023) Pedigree-based estimate of de novo mutation rate in the epaulette shark defines the lowest known vertebrate mutation rate.

Add:
1. read mapping
2. accessory scripts
3. repeat masking
